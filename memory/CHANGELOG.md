## 2026-06-16 — In-place EPUB metadata editing ✅ (P3)

The Edit button on a book detail page now lets users fix **title / author /
description** alongside category and fandom. Edits are written into the
EPUB file itself — so when the book is downloaded or shared, the corrections
travel with it.

**Backend** (`routes/books.py`):
- Extended `UpdateBookBody` with `title`, `author`, `description` (length-capped
  at 500/500/5000 chars to keep paste-bombs from blowing up docs).
- `PATCH /api/books/{book_id}` now updates DB first, then calls the new
  `update_epub_metadata(filepath, title=..., author=..., description=...)`
  helper if any user-visible metadata field changed AND the EPUB exists on
  disk. Response includes `epub_updated: True|False|None`.
- Helper works by surgically rewriting the OPF XML (lxml + zipfile) — not
  via ebooklib's flaky `write_epub`. Chapters, covers, NCX, and every other
  byte stay identical. Only `<dc:title>` / `<dc:creator>` / `<dc:description>`
  get replaced. Atomic .tmp → rename so a crash mid-write can't corrupt.
- Classification fields (category/fandom) are now optional — sending a payload
  with only `{title: "..."}` no longer flips `classifier: manual` falsely.

**Frontend** (`pages/BookDetail.jsx`):
- Edit panel grew Title / Author / Description fields (description is a 4-row
  textarea with `maxLength={5000}`).
- `saveEdit` is diff-aware: only sends fields the user actually changed, so a
  category-only edit doesn't trigger an EPUB rewrite.
- Toast surfaces the rare "EPUB file couldn't be re-saved" case so the user
  knows the DB is updated but the file wasn't.

**Tests** — new `tests/test_inplace_metadata.py`:
- Round-trip: PATCH → download EPUB → ebooklib reads back the new metadata
- Partial edit: only `title` changes, author/description preserved
- `{}` payload returns `noop: true`
- Category-only PATCH leaves `epub_updated: null` (file untouched)
- Length caps enforced at 500/500/5000 chars
- Unauthenticated PATCH → 401/403
- **6/6 passing.**

**Help page** — bumped What's-new (re-prompts users), added a paragraph in
"Detection & overrides" explaining the in-file rewrite and the chapter-safety
guarantee.

## 2026-06-16 — Help page refreshed for the session ✅

`pages/Help.jsx`:
- Bumped What's-new version to `2026-06-16-png-share` (re-prompts dismissed users)
- New What's-new items: "Download your Year in Books as a PNG", "Share links now unfurl rich previews", "Friends DM dots auto-refresh"
- Year-in-Books section now documents the Download-as-PNG + Copy-image buttons, the 1080×1350 portrait format, the browser-support fallback, and the rich-preview unfurl story (server-side 1200×630 OG card on Twitter / iMessage / Slack / Discord / LinkedIn)
- Messages section adds a line about the 20-second auto-refresh of unread dots

Verified e2e: navigated to `/help#year-in-books`, confirmed "Download as PNG",
"Copy image", and "unfurl" copy all rendered.

## 2026-06-16 — Friends DM polling for unread dots ✅ (P3)

The Friends page used to load DM unread counts once on mount, then never
refresh until the user manually navigated or opened/closed a DM drawer.
Switched-back-tab scenario meant the red dot never appeared on new DMs.

- New `useEffect` in `pages/FriendsPage.jsx`: polls `loadDmUnread()` every
  **20 seconds**, but only when:
  - the tab is visible (`document.hidden === false`)
  - no DM drawer is open (the user is already reading the messages)
- Also re-fetches **immediately on `visibilitychange`** so coming back from
  another tab updates the dots without waiting for the next tick.
- Cleans up the interval + listener on unmount and on auth-user change.

**Verified e2e** with screenshot tool + request-counter: 2 `/chat/rooms`
calls on initial mount, +1 call after a 25-second idle wait → polling fires.

## 2026-06-16 — Rate limiting on OG share endpoints ✅

Token enumeration defense for `/api/og/yib/{token}` and `/api/og/yib/{token}/image.png`.
Both are unauthenticated, so without a limit someone could brute-force the
128-bit token space. (Still hopeless, but it's free to make it impossible.)

- New `backend/utils/ratelimit.py` — zero-dep sliding-window limiter, threading.Lock
  guarded, plus a `client_ip()` helper that respects X-Forwarded-For / X-Real-IP.
- Both OG routes now call `_og_limiter.check(client_ip(request))` first.
- Limit: 30 requests per 60s per client IP. Crawlers (Twitter, Slack, Discord,
  Facebook) only ping a few times per unfurl, so this is invisible to real users.
  Excess requests return 429 + `Retry-After` header.
- Test coverage: new `TestOgRateLimit` case in `tests/test_og_share.py` uses a
  one-off X-Forwarded-For so it doesn't poison the limiter for other tests.

## 2026-06-16 — OG/Twitter card meta tags for `/share/yib/:token` ✅ (P2)

Public share links now unfurl with a rich preview in Twitter / iMessage /
Slack / Discord / LinkedIn instead of plain text.

- New backend route `GET /api/og/yib/{token}` returns a tiny HTML stub with
  full OG + Twitter `summary_large_image` meta tags **plus** a `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`
  + JS redirect to the real React route `/share/yib/{token}`. Crawlers ignore
  the redirect and parse the meta; browsers redirect transparently.
- New backend route `GET /api/og/yib/{token}/image.png` returns a 1200×630 PNG
  drawn server-side with Pillow (gradient bg, large serif year, "Your year in books."
  subtitle, "{N} books · {streak}-day streak · in {top_fandom}" tagline).
- `_share_public_url()` now points to `/api/og/yib/{token}` so newly-created
  share URLs are crawler-friendly out of the box. Direct visits to
  `/share/yib/{token}` still work for users who already copied old links.

## 2026-06-16 — PRD split → PRD + CHANGELOG + ROADMAP ✅ (P2)

Old 2820-line `PRD.md` reduced to ~70 lines of static product context, with
all dated work moved here. Full original preserved in `PRD.md.bak`.

## 2026-06-16 — AuthContext `refresh()` alias ✅ (P1)

One-liner: `AuthContext.Provider` value now also includes `refresh: checkAuth`.
Any component that wants to heal stale user state (e.g. after granting an
admin consent, after a manual approval, after an account flag flip) can now
`const { refresh } = useAuth(); await refresh();` without importing the
internal `checkAuth` name. No breaking change.

## 2026-06-16 — Copy-to-clipboard companion to PNG export ✅

Added a "Copy image" pill next to "Download as PNG" on the Wrapped outro,
using `html-to-image#toBlob` + `navigator.clipboard.write([ClipboardItem])`.
One-tap paste into Instagram / Threads / iMessage stories.

Capability-gated via a `canCopyImage` boolean (checks `window.ClipboardItem` +
`navigator.clipboard.write`) so the button is **never** rendered in Firefox or
older Safari that can't actually copy images. Failure path toasts a friendly
"try Download as PNG instead" hint instead of throwing.

**Verified e2e**: clicked Copy → success toast shown → `navigator.clipboard.read()`
inside the page confirmed `image/png` payload present.

## 2026-06-16 — PNG export of Year in Books (Wrapped) ✅

**Why**: Year in Books is the most shareable thing Shelfsort produces, but
sharing a 9-slide scroll-jacked recap on social is awkward. A single Instagram-
friendly portrait (1080×1350 @ 2× = 2160×2700) lets users post their year in
one tap — high-leverage organic growth surface.

**What shipped**
- New `frontend/src/components/YearInBooksShareCard.jsx` — purely-inline-styled
  forwardRef component, sized 1080×1350, designed for `html-to-image` capture
  (no Tailwind class deps that could fail to serialize, no images, system+
  Georgia fallback fonts so a Google-fonts CORS hiccup never produces an ugly
  fallback).
- `YearInBooksPage.jsx` now renders the card off-screen
  (`position:fixed; left:-99999px`), exposes a "Download as PNG" button on the
  outro slide (alongside Email / Share), and downloads via
  `html-to-image#toPng(..., { pixelRatio: 2, cacheBust: true })` →
  `shelfsort-wrapped-{year}.png`.
- Toast feedback ("Saved! Share it anywhere.") and disabled state during render.
- Public share surface (`/share/yib/:token`) intentionally **not** exposing the
  download — only the owner can grab their own card.

**Card content (single tasteful default, no multi-slide montage)**
- Header: "Shelfsort wrapped" + year
- Hero: huge serif `{year}` + "Your year in books." italic subtitle
- Stats row: Books · Pages · Streak
- Highlights: Top world (top fandom), Top voice (top author), Reading peak (best month)
- Footer: from shelfsort.app · SHELFSORT brandmark

**Verified e2e via screenshot tool**: button visible → click triggers download →
2160×2700 PNG (8.3 MB) saved with correct filename. Image-analyze pass confirmed
all elements rendered, no glitches, layout clean.

**Dependencies**: `html-to-image@1.11.13` added via yarn.

## Pre-2026-06-16 history

All sessions from 2026-02-28 through 2026-06-15 (Year-in-Books Wrapped redesign,
Admin Approval Gate, View-As-User consent flow, test-failure mop-up, 22 ghost
user purge, ACOTAR/Friends/House M.D. fandoms, etc.) are preserved verbatim in
`PRD.md.bak`. They were folded out of the live PRD on 2026-06-16 to keep this
document scannable.
